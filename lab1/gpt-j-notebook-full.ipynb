    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Language models have recently exploded in both size and popularity. In 2018, BERT-large entered the scene and, with its 340M parameters and novel transformer architecture, set the standard on NLP task accuracy. Within just a few years, state-of-the-art NLP model size has grown by more than 500x with models such as OpenAI’s 175 billion parameter GPT-3 and similarly sized open source Bloom 176B raising the bar on NLP accuracy. This increase in the number of parameters is driven by the simple and empirically-demonstrated positive relationship between model size and accuracy: more is better. With easy access from models zoos such as HuggingFace and improved accuracy in NLP tasks such as classification and text generation, practitioners are increasingly reaching for these large models. However, deploying them can be a challenge because of their size.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this Lab, we'll explore how to host a large language model on Amazon SageMaker using Sagemaker Inference, one of many ready-to-use AWS Deep Learning Containers (DLCs) and the built-in HuggingFace integration of the Sagemaker SDK. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Background and Details\n",
    "We'll be working with GPT-J , a large language model with over 6B parameters pre-trained on the Pile dataset. The pre-trained weights of the original model come in FP32 format (4 bytes per parameter) and combine to roughly 24Gb in total. Since most of today's state-of-the-art single-GPU-powered instances are only equipped with 16, max. 24 GPU GB memory, the size of the model weights is bringing up challenges for model inference. With quantization, we'll explore one of several optimization options available that allow us to host this model on single GPU instances with fewer than 16Gb of GPU memory. Finally, we take a closer look into the art of prompt engineering and discover how [few-shot](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2021/05/an-introduction-to-few-shot-learning/) (as opposed to zero-shot) approaches can significantly improve model performance on a huge variety of NLP tasks. \n",

    "# Create Model Artifact Archive\n",
    "\n",
    "For hosting a model with AWS SageMaker Inference we need to package our model artifacts into an archive called ‘model.tar.gz’ and upload it to S3. Within this archive, your model artifacts should be stored in the following directory structure:\n",
    "\n",
    "`model.tar.gz`\n",
    "- `model.bin`\n",
    "- `code/`\n",
    "  - `inference.py`\n",
    "  - `requirements.txt`\n",
    "\n",
    "The \"code\" directory contains your inference script (inference.py) and your requirements.txt file (if you have additional dependencies, detailed description see below). The “model.bin” file is a file in one of various binary formats containing the model weights as well as some configuration. In our case this will be non-existing at archive creation time, since we will be loading our model files on endpoint-start time from the HuggingFace model hub. Before you continue, open the code directory to get familiar with the structure and be able to follow when going through the subsequent steps below.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have additional dependencies for your model, you can include them in a requirements.txt file in the \"code\" directory. SageMaker will install these dependencies during the deployment of your model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes you may want to override one of the [five functions](https://huggingface.co/docs/sagemaker/inference#user-defined-code-and-modules) within the hosting cycle, such as the model_fn function. To do this, you can create a new function in your inference.py file with the same name as the function you want to override. SageMaker will automatically use your new function instead of the default function. Since we want to dynamically load the model binaries on endpoint-start time, we will override the model_fn, the default method for loading a model. \n",
    "\n",
    "Within the model_fn() function of inference.py, this can be done by leveraging the capabilities of HuggingFace. HuggingFace is a company focussing on democratisation of open-source AI and closely partnering with AWS. With the ‘transformers’ library, they have created a popular open-source API/framework for natural language processing on top of common frameworks like PyTorch or Tensorflow. They have also built the HuggingFace model hub, a model repository providing thousands of open-source models throughout different ML tasks. \n",
    "\n",
    "SageMaker provides built-in support for HuggingFace models through the SageMaker HuggingFace SDK. Here are the steps we will take to dynamically load our model from the HuggingFace model hub into SageMaker:\n",
    "1. Import the transformers library\n",
    "2. Use the from_pretrained method to download a pre-built tokenised together with a pre-trained model from the HuggingFace Model Hub\n",
    "```python\n",
    "tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(\"EleutherAI/gpt-j-6B\")\n",
    "model = GPTJForCausalLM.from_pretrained(\"EleutherAI/gpt-j-6B\", revision=\"float16\", torch_dtype=torch.float16)\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "3. Use the pipeline method to perform inference on your text data. These pipelines can be configured to be task specific. For our use case we will use the [‘text-generation’ task](link***)\n",
    "```python\n",
    "generation = pipeline(\"text-generation\", model=model, tokenizer=tokenizer, device=device)\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "4. Pass the generated pipeline object as return value of the model_fn() function to integrate with the rest of the inference lifecycle\n",
    "\n",
    "The pre-trained weights of the original model come in FP32 format (4 bytes per parameter) and combine to roughly 24Gb in total. Since most of today's state-of-the-art single-GPU-powered instances are only equipped with 16, max. 24 GPU GB memory, the size of the model weights is bringing up challenges for model inference. Quantization is a technique to reduce the memory footprint when hosting large models. Thereby, the model weights are converted into FP16 or int8 format, resulting into a reduction of the hosting footprint by 2-4. By applying quantization, the GPT-J model can be hosted on a single-gpu instance like the ml.g4dn series.\n",
    "The from_pretrained method in the HuggingFace SDK allows you to download different revisions of a pre-trained model from the HuggingFace Model Hub. You can specify the revision you want to download using the revision parameter. For our use case, we will be using the FP16 revision of the model weights.\n"

    "In addition, [few-shot learning](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2021/05/an-introduction-to-few-shot-learning/) is an interesting approach for the context element of a prompt. Few-shot learning is a prompt engineering technique that enables models to learn new tasks or concepts from only a few examples (usually a single digit number is just fine) or samples. Despite of the fact that the model has never seen this task in the training phase, we experience a significant boost in performance. "
