    "# Lab 4 - Building the LLM-powered chatbot \"AWSomeChat\" with retrieval-augmented generation\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Language models have recently exploded in both size and popularity. In 2018, BERT-large entered the scene and, with its 340M parameters and novel transformer architecture, set the standard on NLP task accuracy. Within just a few years, state-of-the-art NLP model size has grown by more than 500x with models such as OpenAI’s 175 billion parameter GPT-3 and similarly sized open source Bloom 176B raising the bar on NLP accuracy. This increase in the number of parameters is driven by the simple and empirically-demonstrated positive relationship between model size and accuracy: more is better. With easy access from models zoos such as HuggingFace and improved accuracy in NLP tasks such as classification and text generation, practitioners are increasingly reaching for these large models. However, deploying them can be a challenge because of their size. \n",
    "\n",
    "While these models are able to generalize quite well and hence are capable to perform a vast amount of different generic tasks without having specifically being trained on them, they also lack domain-specific, proprietary and recent knowledge. This however is required in most use cases across organisations. With fine-tuning, in Lab 2 we already learned an option to infuse domain-specific or proprietary knowledge into a Large Language Model. However, this option can become complex and costly, especially if carried out on a regular basis to ensure access to recent information. Luckily there are several design patterns wrapping Large Language Models into powerful applications able to overcome even these challenges with a leightweight footprint. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this Lab, we'll explore how to build GenAI-powered applications capable of performing tasks within a specific domain. The application we will be building in a step-by-step process leverages the retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) design pattern and consists of multiple components ranging out of the broad service portfolio of AWS. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Background and Details\n",
    "\n",
    "We have two primary [types of knowledge for LLMs](https://www.pinecone.io/learn/langchain-retrieval-augmentation/): \n",
    "- **Parametric knowledge**: refers to everything the LLM learned during training and acts as a frozen snapshot of the world for the LLM. \n",
    "- **Source knowledge**: covers any information fed into the LLM via the input prompt. \n",
    "\n",
    "When trying to infuse knowledge into a generative AI - powered application we need to choose which of these types to target. Lab 2 deals with elevating the parametric knowledge through fine-tuning. Since fine-tuning is a resouce intensive operation, this option is well suited for infusing static domain-specific information like domain-specific langauage/writing styles (medical domain, science domain, ...) or optimizing performance towards a very specific task (classification, sentiment analysis, RLHF, instruction-finetuning, ...). \n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast to that, targeting the source knowledge for domain-specific performance uplift is very well suited for all kinds of dynamic information, from knowledge bases in structured and unstructured form up to integration of information from live systems. This Lab is about retrieval-augmented generation, a common design pattern for ingesting domain-specific information through the source knowledge. It is particularily well suited for ingestion of information in form of unstructured text with semi-frequent update cycles. \n",
    "\n",
    "The application we will be building in this lab will be a LLM-powered chatbot infused with domain specific knowledge on AWS services. You will be able to chat through a chatbot frontend and receive information going beyond the parametric knowledge encoded in the model. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)\n",
    "\n",
    "![rag-concept](../img/rag-concept.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The design pattern of retrieval-augmented generation is depicted in the above figure. It works as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Step 0: Knowledge documents / document sequences are encoded and ingested into a vector database. \n",
    "- Step 1: Customer e-mail query is pre-processed and/or tokenized\n",
    "- Step 2: Tokenized input query is encoded\n",
    "- Step 3: Encoded query is used to retrieve most similar text passages in document index using vector similarity search (e.g., Mixed Inner Product Search)\n",
    "- Step 4: Top-k retrieved documents/text passages in combination with original customer e-mail query and e-mail generation prompt are fed into Generator model (Encoder-Decoder) to generate response e-mail\n",
    "\n",
    "### Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "![rag-architecture](../img/rag-architecture.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Above figure shows the architecture for the LLM-powered chatbot with retrieval-augmented generation component we will be implementing in this lab. It consists of the following components:\n",
    "- Document store & semantic search: We leverage semantic document search service Amazon Kendra as fully managed embeddings/vector store as well as for a fully managed solution for document retrieval based on questions/asks in natural language.\n",
    "- Response generation: For the chatbot response generation, we use the open-source encoder-decoder model FLAN-T5-XXL conveniently deployed in a one-click fashion through Amazon SageMaker JumpStart right into your VPC.\n",
    "- Orchestration layer: For hosting the orchestration layer implmented with the popular framework langchain we choose a serverless approach. The orchestration layer is exposed as RESTful API service via a Amazon API Gateway.\n",
    "- Conversational Memory: In order to be able to keep track of different chatbot conversation turns while keeping the orchestration layer stateless we integrate the chatbot's memory with Amazon DynamoDB as a storage component.\n",
    "- Frontend: The chatbot frontend is a web application hosted in a Docker container on Amazon ECS. For storing the container image we leverage Amazon ECR. The website is exposed through an Amazon Elastic Load Balancer. \n",

    "\n",
    "Unlike traditional keyword-based search, Amazon Kendra uses its semantic and contextual understanding capabilities to decide whether a document is relevant to a search query. It returns specific answers to questions, giving users an experience that's close to interacting with a human expert.\n",
    "\n",
    "With Amazon Kendra, you can create a unified search experience by connecting multiple data repositories to an index and ingesting and crawling documents. You can use your document metadata to create a feature-rich and customized search experience for your users, helping them efficiently find the right answers to their queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Querying with Amazon Kendra\n",
    "You can ask Amazon Kendra the following types of queries:\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Factoid questions</b> — Simple who, what, when, or where questions, such as <i>Where is the nearest service center to Seattle</i>? Factoid questions have fact-based answers that can be returned as a single word or phrase. The answer is retrieved from a FAQ or from your indexed documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Descriptive questions</b> — Questions where the answer could be a sentence, passage, or an entire document. For example, <i>How do I connect my Echo Plus to my network? Or, How do I get tax benefits for lower income families? </i>\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Keyword and natural language questions</b> — Questions that include complex, conversational content where the intended meaning may not be clear. For example, <i>keynote address</i>. When Amazon Kendra encounters a word like “address”—which has multiple contextual meanings—it correctly infers the intended meaning behind the search query and returns relevant information.\n",

    "## Benefits of Amazon Kendra\n",
    "Amazon Kendra is highly scalable, capable of meeting performance demands, is tightly integrated with other AWS services such as Amazon S3 and Amazon Lex, and offers enterprise-grade security. Some of the benefits of using Amazon Kendra include:\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Simplicity</b> — Amazon Kendra provides a console and API for managing the documents that you want to search. You can use a simple search API to integrate Amazon Kendra into your client applications, such as websites or mobile applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Connectivity</b> — Amazon Kendra can connect to third-party data repositories or data sources such as Microsoft SharePoint. You can easily index and search your documents using your data source.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Accuracy</b> — Unlike traditional search services that use keyword searches, Amazon Kendra attempts to understand the context of the question and returns the most relevant word, snippet, or document for your query. Amazon Kendra uses machine learning to improve search results over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Security</b> — Amazon Kendra delivers a highly secure enterprise search experience. Your search results reflect the security model of your organization and can be filtered based on the user or group access to documents. Customers are responsible for authenticating and authorizing user access.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Incremental Learning</b> - Amazon Kendra uses incremental learning to improve search results. Using feedback from queries, incremental learning improves the ranking algorithms and optimizes search results for greater accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, suppose that your users search for the phrase \"health care benefits.\" If users consistently choose the second result from the list, over time Amazon Kendra boosts that result to the first place result. The boost decreases over time, so if users stop selecting a result, Amazon Kendra eventually removes it and shows another more popular result instead. This helps Amazon Kendra prioritize results based on relevance, age, and content.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Creation of a Kendra index\n",
    "To use Kendra for retrieval-augmented generation we need to first create a Kendra index. This index will hold all the knowledge we want to infuse into our LLM-powered chatbot application. To create a Kendra index follow the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "![kendra-index-create.gif](../img/kendra-index-create.gif)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Using Kendra with LLMs \n",
    "Now that we have a understanding of the basics of Kendra, we want to use it for the indexing of our documents. Kendra Indexing allows us to query our enterprise knowledge base, without us having to worry about how to handle different data types (pdf, xml) in S3, connectors to SaaS applications as well as webpages. \n",
    "\n",
    "We will use Kendra as outlined in the following architecture diagram:\n",
    "<p align=\"center\">\n",
    "  <img src=\"../img/KendraArchitecture.png\" alt=\"Kendra Architecture as outlined on https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/quickly-build-high-accuracy-generative-ai-applications-on-enterprise-data-using-amazon-kendra-langchain-and-large-language-models/\">\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We use an Amazon Kendra index to ingest enterprise unstructured data from data sources such as wiki pages, MS SharePoint sites, Atlassian Confluence, and document repositories such as Amazon S3. When a user interacts with the GenAI app, the flow is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The user makes a request to the GenAI app.\n",
    "2. The app issues a search query to the Amazon Kendra index based on the user request.\n",
    "3. The index returns search results with excerpts of relevant documents from the ingested enterprise data.\n",
    "4. The app sends the user request and along with the data retrieved from the index as context in the LLM prompt.\n",
    "5. The LLM returns a succinct response to the user request based on the retrieved data.\n",
    "6. The response from the LLM is sent back to the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "With this architecture, you can choose the most suitable LLM for your use case. LLM options include our partners Hugging Face, AI21 Labs, Cohere, and others hosted on an Amazon SageMaker endpoint, as well as models by companies like Anthropic and OpenAI. With Amazon Bedrock, you will be able to choose Amazon Titan, Amazon’s own LLM, or partner LLMs such as those from AI21 Labs and Anthropic with APIs securely without the need for your data to leave the AWS ecosystem. The additional benefits that Amazon Bedrock will offer include a serverless architecture, a single API to call the supported LLMs, and a managed service to streamline the developer workflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our implementation we will be leveraging SageMaker Foundation Models based on FlanT5.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Uploading knowledge documents into an Amazon Kendra index\n",
    "\n",
    "Next we are going to add some more documents from S3 to show how easy it is to integrate different data sources to a Kendra Index. \n",
    "First we are going to download some interesting pdf files from the internet, but please feel free to drop any pdf you might find interesting in it as well. "

    "# Orchestration layer\n",
    "\n",
    "We encapsulate the execution of the single steps involved in the retrieval-augmented generation design pattern into an orchestration layer. For a convenient developer experience we utilize the popular framework langchain for this.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Langchain\n",
    "\n",
    "[LangChain](https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/) is a framework for developing applications powered by language models. We believe that the most powerful and differentiated applications will not only call out to a language model via an api, but will also:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Be data-aware: connect a language model to other sources of data\n",
    "- Be agentic: Allow a language model to interact with its environment\n",
    "\n",
    "As such, the LangChain framework is designed with the objective in mind to enable those types of applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two main value props the LangChain framework provides:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Components: LangChain provides modular abstractions for the components neccessary to work with language models. LangChain also has collections of implementations for all these abstractions. The components are designed to be easy to use, regardless of whether you are using the rest of the LangChain framework or not.\n",
    "- Use-Case Specific Chains: Chains can be thought of as assembling these components in particular ways in order to best accomplish a particular use case. These are intended to be a higher level interface through which people can easily get started with a specific use case. These chains are also designed to be customizable.\n",
    "Accordingly, we split the following documentation into those two value props. In this documentation, we go over components and use cases at high level and in a language-agnostic way. For language-specific ways of using these components and tackling these use cases, please see the language-specific sections linked at the top of the page.\n",
    "\n",
    "### KendraIndexRetriever\n",
    "\n",
    "Indexes refer to ways to structure documents so that LLMs can best interact with them. The most common way that indexes are used in chains is in a \"retrieval\" step. This step refers to taking a user's query and returning the most relevant documents. We draw this distinction because (1) an index can be used for other things besides retrieval, and (2) retrieval can use other logic besides an index to find relevant documents. We therefor have a concept of a \"Retriever\" interface - this is the interface that most chains work with.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most of the time when we talk about indexes and retrieval we are talking about indexing and retrieving unstructured data (like text documents). For interacting with structured data (SQL tables, etc) or APIs there is other design patterns we will not cover in this lab. The primary index and retrieval types supported by LangChain are currently centered around vector databases and document retrieval systems, Kendra being one of them.\n",
    "\n",
    "### ConversationalBufferWindowMemory \n",
    "Memory is the concept of storing and retrieving data in the process of a conversation. There are two main methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Based on input, fetch any relevant pieces of data\n",
    "- Based on the input and output, update state accordingly\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two main types of memory: short term and long term.\n",
    "\n",
    "Short term memory generally refers to how to pass data in the context of a singular conversation (generally is previous ChatMessages or summaries of them), while long term memory deals with how to fetch and update information between conversations. In this lab we will focus on short term memory in the form of the ```ConversationalBufferWindowMemory```. \n",
    "\n",
    "```ConversationBufferWindowMemory``` keeps a list of the interactions of the conversation over time. It only uses the last K interactions. This can be useful for keeping a sliding window of the most recent interactions, so the buffer does not get too large. \n",
    "\n",
    "### DynamoDBChatMessageHistory\n",
    "\n",
    "In their plain form, langchain's memory classes store the conversation in-memory. However this approach is not working when hosting the orchestration layer as a stateless microservice. To overcome this langchain offers ChatMessageHistory classes as memory plugins, interfacing to durable storage backends. The ```DynamoDBChatMessageHistory``` class leverages Amazon DynamoDB to store the chat message history in a durable manner. It supports session management by leveraging a session_id parameter matching the partition key in the DynamoDB schema.\n",
    "\n",
    "### SageMakerEndpoint\n",
    "\n",
    "For encapsulating funcionality around LLM inference, langchain provides the LLM class specifically designed for interfacing with LLMs. There are lots of LLM providers on the market, as well as a huge variety of hosting. This class is designed to provide a standard interface for all of them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Amazon SageMaker is a system that can build, train, and deploy machine learning (ML) models for any use case with fully managed infrastructure, tools, and workflows. Inheriting from the generic LLM class, the ```SageMakerEndpoint```class provides functionality specifically tied to LLMs hosted via SageMaker Endpoints through a standard interface. Thereby it uses the endpoint name as unique identifier for the targeted endpoint.\n",
    "\n",
    "### PromptTemplate\n",
    "\n",
    "The new way of programming models is through prompts. A \"prompt\" refers to the input to the model. This input is rarely hard coded, but rather is often constructed from multiple components. A PromptTemplate is responsible for the construction of this input. LangChain provides several classes and functions to make constructing and working with prompts easy, ```PromptTemplate``` being one of them.\n",
    "\n",
    "A PromptValue is what is eventually passed to the model. Most of the time, this value is not hardcoded but is rather dynamically created based on a combination of user input, other non-static information (often coming from multiple sources), and a fixed template string. We call the object responsible for creating the PromptValue a ```PromptTemplate```. This object exposes a method for taking in input variables and returning a PromptValue.\n",
    "\n",
    "### ConversationalRetrievalChain\n",
    "\n",
    "Chains is an incredibly generic concept which returns to a sequence of modular components (or other chains) combined in a particular way to accomplish a common use case.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ```ConversationalRetrievalChain``` is a special purpose chain designed for chatbot implementations infusing knowledge via retrieval-augmented generation. \n",
    "This chain has two steps. First, it condenses the current question and the chat history into a standalone question. This is neccessary to create a standanlone ask to use for retrieval. After that, it does retrieval and then answers the question using retrieval-augmented generation with a separate model. Part of the power of the declarative nature of LangChain is that you can easily use a separate language model for each call. This can be useful to use a cheaper and faster model for the simpler task of condensing the question, and then a more expensive model for answering the question. However, within this lab we will be using one model for both steps.\n",

However, this is out of scope for this workshop.

    "\n",
    "To conclude, RAG can be a very helpful approach to augment your company internal and external search. The retrieval and LLM quality are of high importance to this approach, and the generated load on the systems can be substantial. Especially here, a careful cost consideration between a token based and an infrastructure based pricing model should be done. \n"
